MXP/XRE Example Application
----

**Overall Goal**: To produce a basic example mozilla application on modern mozilla.

**Functional Feature Goals**: Main Window with Menubar, Toolbar, Single Browser (not tabbed), and statusbar, a Preferences Window, Downloads Handling, and Places (History and Bookmarks).

**Target Operating Systems**: Linux/Win64 minimum, anything Firefox Desktop targets wanted.

**Build Instructions**: Soon.

Until all blocking bugs in `mozilla-central` are filed and resolved within upstream, the current platform codebase that this builds from is located: https://github.com/binaryoutcast/mozxhtml-platform.git which is currently at `mozilla-rel122`.
